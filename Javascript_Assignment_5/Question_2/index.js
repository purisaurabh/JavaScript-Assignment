// What do you think would happen if you pass an index beyond the range of the string? Or if you pass a negative index? Try it out.
let str = "variable"

// pass the value beyond the string length
console.log(str[10]);

// pass the negative index value
console.log(str[-1]);


// in both the case it will give an output as undefined
